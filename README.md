# PathFinder-TSP

A Python implementation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver using the **Nearest Neighbor** heuristic with step-by-step visualization and animated path display.



## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Salah-Tamer/PathFinder-TSP.git
cd PathFinder-TSP
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the demo

```bash
python tsp_demo.py
```

## Features 

- Step-by-step visualization of the Nearest Neighbor algorithm.

- Animated movement between cities.

- Displays current distance and best path.

- Includes graphical enhancements for clarity and better user experience.



## Limitations

The Nearest Neighbor heuristic is a greedy approach that is fast and scalable, but it does not guarantee the optimal solution. For better accuracy in larger datasets, consider adding or comparing with algorithms like:

1- opt Optimization

2- Simulated Annealing

3- Genetic Algorithms

4- Ant Colony Optimization
